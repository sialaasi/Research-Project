This project involves detecting Alzheimer's disease using machine learning techniques. The implementation leverages Python and key libraries such as TensorFlow, NumPy, and Pandas.
I have carried out a CNN and ResNet50 implementations, based on EfficientNetb0 for feature extracting.
Accuracy 94.47%
validation Accuracy 91.91%
In the next lines, there is the description of the code file that what is the functionality of the code:
**Library Imports:** These lines of the code are to import necessary libraries or modules.
**Data Loading and Preprocessing:** This portion loads datasets, and cleans or preprocesses data.
**Feature Engineering:** These Cells are dedicated to preparing features for analysis.
**Model Training:** Includes code for training machine learning models.
**Model Evaluation:** Cells for testing models and checking performance metrics.
**Data Visualization:** Includes plotting data to understand patterns or results.
**Utility Functions:** Custom functions or reusable code snippets.
**Saving Results:** Code for storing output like model predictions or metrics.
**GUI** This portion of the code is to show the results by uploading an image in the system and the system tells about the stage of the disease.
